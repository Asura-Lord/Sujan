## 🔥 Quick intro
I tinker with systems, networks, and code — always learning and building in **lab environments only**.  
Focus areas: **ethical hacking**, **CTFs**, **vulnerability research**, and **security automation**.

---

## 🎯 Snapshot
- **Alias:** Sujan  
- **Focus:** Ethical hacking · Vulnerability research · Security automation · CTFs  
- **Languages:** Python · JavaScript · Bash · (learning Go)  
- **Tools:** Nmap · Burp Suite · Wireshark · Ghidra · Docker · Elastic/Kibana  
- **Setup:** Neovim · tmux · zsh · Docker labs

## 🔐 Responsible / Ethical Statement
Everything here is for education, labs, and authorized tests only. I do **not** perform unauthorized attacks. If you find something in my public work that looks insecure, file an issue — let's fix it together.

---

## 🛠 What I'm learning now
- Practical web pentesting (lab-only): XSS, SQLi, auth bypass chains in controlled boxes  
- SIEM & detection: Elastic/Kibana playbooks and logging pipelines  
- Automation: Python scripts for safe recon and lab automation  
- CTF practice: writeups and small tooling

---

## 📌 Featured / Projects
> Lab-safe, portfolio-ready repos.

### ✅ Completed
- **recon-automator** — lab-safe recon automation (Nmap + HTTP checks + optional dir fuzzing) → produces clean `summary.json`. Ready for CTFs, learning, and defensive detection practice. Demo results included in `sample_results/`. ⭐

### 🔜 Side / Upcoming
- **pentest-lab-automation** — scripts & compose files to spin up vulnerable VMs/containers (DVWA, Juice Shop) for safe practice.  
- **vuln-notify** — demo service that parses CVE feeds and sends sanitized alerts to webhooks (lab/demo only).  
- **ctf-tools** — small helpers for CTFs: encoders/decoders, format converters, and writeup templates.  
- **dotfiles** — my terminal/dev environment configs (neovim, tmux, zsh, aliases) tuned for lab workflows.
