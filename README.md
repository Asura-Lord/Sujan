ðŸ”¥ Hacker Vibe (but ethical)

I live for systems, networks, and the thrill of understanding how things really work.
I tinker, break in controlled labs, and build tools that protect â€” not hurt.
No unauthorized attacks. Lab-only. CTFs and responsible disclosure.

ðŸ”­ Currently Learning & Building

Practical web pentesting (lab-only): XSS, SQLi, auth bypass chains (in controlled boxes).

Detection & logging: SIEM basics and Elastic/Kibana playbooks.

Automation: Python scripts for safe recon in my lab (not for live targets).

CTF practice: writeups, small tooling, and riffing on exploit chains inside VMs.

ðŸ§© Featured (What I pin / will pin)

These are lab-oriented, documented, and safe for anyone to fork and learn from.

1) pentest-lab-automation

Spin up isolated lab VMs/containers for practice. Pre-installed intentionally vulnerable apps (DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop), instrumented with monitoring so I can learn detection as I attack in my lab.

2) vuln-notify

A personal, lab-safe notifier that demonstrates how to fetch CVE feeds and produce sanitized alerts. Useful as a learning exercise for parsing feeds and integrating webhook notifications in a safe environment.

3) ctf-tools

Small, harmless helpers for CTF tasks: encoders/decoders, format converters, and note templates for writeups. No challenge binaries â€” just tools to speed up learning.

4) dotfiles

My terminal setup: neovim, tmux, zsh, aliases, and helpful dev ergonomics for hacking (lab-only workflows).
