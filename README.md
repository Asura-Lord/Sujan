## 🔥 Quick intro
I tinker with systems, networks, and code — always learning and building in **lab environments only**.  
Focus areas: **ethical hacking**, **CTFs**, **vulnerability research**, and **security automation**.

---

## 🎯 Snapshot
- **Alias:** Sujan  
- **Focus:** Ethical hacking · Vulnerability research · Security automation · CTFs  
- **Languages:** Python · JavaScript · Bash · (learning Go)  
- **Tools:** Nmap · Burp Suite · Wireshark · Ghidra · Docker · Elastic/Kibana  
- **Setup:** Neovim · tmux · zsh · Docker labs

---

## 🔐 Responsible / Ethical Statement
Everything here is for education, labs, and authorized tests only. I do **not** perform unauthorized attacks. If you find something in my public work that looks insecure, file an issue — let's fix it together.

---

## 🛠 What I'm learning now
- Practical web pentesting (lab-only): XSS, SQLi, auth bypass chains in controlled boxes  
- SIEM & detection: Elastic/Kibana playbooks and logging pipelines  
- Automation: Python scripts for safe recon and lab automation  
- CTF practice: writeups and small tooling

---

## 📌 Featured (to be pinned)
> I keep these repos lab-safe and documented.

- **pentest-lab-automation** — scripts and compose files to spin up vulnerable VMs/containers for learning.  
- **vuln-notify** — a demo service that parses CVE feeds and sends sanitized alerts to webhooks (lab/demo only).  
- **ctf-tools** — helpful encoders/decoders and small scripts used while doing CTFs.  
- **dotfiles** — my terminal/dev environment configs (neovim, tmux, zsh, aliases).
